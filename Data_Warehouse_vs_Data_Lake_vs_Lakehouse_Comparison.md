## 1. Data Warehouse: The Traditional Powerhouse 🏛️

### Core Characteristics
```sql
-- Typical Data Warehouse Schema (Star Schema)
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
    sale_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_key INT FOREIGN KEY,
    product_key INT FOREIGN KEY,
    time_key INT FOREIGN KEY,
    store_key INT FOREIGN KEY,
    sales_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    quantity_sold INT,
    discount_amount DECIMAL(8,2)
);

CREATE TABLE dim_customer (
    customer_key INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(50),
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    customer_segment VARCHAR(50),
    geography VARCHAR(100)
);
```

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Lakehouse").getOrCreate()

# Create Delta table with ACID properties
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/delta/sales_data")

# ACID updates (not possible in traditional data lakes)
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/delta/sales_data")
deltaTable.update(
    condition = "customer_type = 'premium'",
    set = {"discount_rate": "0.15"}

# 2. Migrate historical data
historical_data = spark.read.jdbc(warehouse_url, "sales_history")
historical_data.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("/lakehouse/sales_new")

# 3. Create unified view
spark.sql("""
CREATE VIEW unified_sales AS
SELECT * FROM delta.`/lakehouse/sales_new`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM legacy_warehouse.sales_archive
""")
```
